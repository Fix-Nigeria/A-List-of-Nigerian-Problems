# A-List-of-Nigerian-Problems
It is almost impossible to tell if you're making progress without a clear way to track your goals.
The goal of this repository is to provide a forum for people to propose solutions to issues Nigeria has. 
Issues would be created and closed once they're resolved. If they are ever resolved.

### Repo Rules
- This is a safe space, everybody's opinion would be respected. We would not address people with disrespect even if we don't agree with their opinion.

##### Note: It's currently a private repo because I thought it would make more sense for us to give the repo some flesh before actually going public with it.
