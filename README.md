# A-List-of-Nigerian-Problems
It is almost impossible to tell if you're making progress without a way to track goals.
The goal of this repository is to provide a forum for people to propose solutions to issues Nigeria has. 
Issues would be created and closed once they're resolved. If they are ever resolved. 

### A Few Ideas On Issues You Can Create
- Youth Commiting Suicide
- The State of Electricity
- Bad Roads
- The Police
- The Army
- The State of Public Schools
